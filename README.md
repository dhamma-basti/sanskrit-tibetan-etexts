# sanskrit-tibetan-etext
This is a collection of sentence-level aligned Sanskrit-Tibetan etexts. The Tibetan etexts have been taken from ACIP (https://asianclassics.org/), the Sanskrit etexts from GRETIL (http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de)
The alignment-quality is good (overall must be somewhere around 95%), however there will be occasional mistakes. 
Feel free to open an issue or send me a mail in case you have own etexts that you want to have aligned!
